1. Start by initilizing an empty shelf/list of books
2. If there are no books left, go to step 7, otherwise go to step 3
3. Pick up a book from the unsorted pile and look at its title
4. Starting at the first book in your shelf/list, call it book A and look at its title.
5. Compare the title of Book A with the title of the book you are holding.
6. If the title of the book you are holding is alphabetically smaller than the title of Book A, place the book you are holding directly in front of book A, and move back to step 2; otherwise call the next book right after book A the new book A, and move back to step 5.
7. You have sorted all the books in the pile.
